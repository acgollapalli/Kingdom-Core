# QUIC module

This module is an interface surrounding msquic, Microsofts QUIC implementation.
I've tried to create an interface that would allow it to be eventually replaced with a native jai implementation. However, porting my incomplete QUIC implementation done in Odin to jai is not currently feasible due to time constraints.

So that's how it goes.
